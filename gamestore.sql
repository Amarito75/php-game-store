Some of these shards have fallen into the hands of the children of Queen Marika the Eternal, and the promise of even more power has corrupted each of the six demi-gods.<br> <br>\nThe people who live on the land, used to enjoy the Grace of the Ring, given by the Erdtree, which showed with a kind of golden glow in the eyes – this glow has faded, indicating the loss of Grace, and those who remain are now called ‘the Tarnished.’ You are one of them, an exile from the Lands Between, because of the loss of Grace – and now it is your job to find the shards, restore the Ring and become Elden Lord, returning good to the land. <br> <br>\nThe Lands Between is a vast open world system so you can wander through the six regions (one per boss/ demi-god) in the Lands Between: <br>\nexploring castles, fortresses, catacombs, caves, grassy plains, suffocating swamps, spiralling mountains and so much more.<br> <br>\nEach demi-god (being one of the Queen’s children) rules their section of the land, and eventually defeating them is the equivalent of a boss battle. All defeated enemies are transformed into spirits who can then be summoned to help you out when you need it. This summoning is also available in multiplayer mode – although in this case you call up other players to give you a hand! <br> <br>\nFor unexplained reasons, you have a spectral horse to ride as you wrest the shards from the demi-gods and hope to impress the Erdtree into restoring your Grace. <br> <br> <h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2><br>\nThe intense combat scenes thrive on close-up melees in which you get hands-on with the enemies. However, there is also a newly introduced stealth mode for those who prefer to sidle past rather than attack. <br> <br>\nInstead of skill trees, you will find advances in skill and weaponry by exploring the map and discovering hoards, crafting what you need, and chatting to NCPs and demons alike to see what tips and gifts they can offer you. <br> <br>\nThe character is fully customisable so you can tweak your look to your own satisfaction. Gameplay, while hard, is still not be as tricky as some of the Souls games. Pay attention to the weather, though, as there is a weather and time system which can affect your success rate. <br> <br>\nOther details to be aware of include the fact that you can fast travel between places, there is a central hub area which you can access after completing the game to a pre-set point – access to it is not given, it must be earned! Your stamina bar is a useful measure of how you’re doing, you can change readily between the wide array of weapons, and your magical horse can go straight up sheer cliffs!<br> <br> <h2>Ways to Play</h2><br> <li> Story Mode: Single player mode sees you exploring the large and detailed open world setting, exploring to your heart’s content and solving quests as you like</li><br> <li>PVP: Multi-player mode sets you up against fellow players to battle to see who is the best!</li><br> <li>Co-op: Play with up to three of your friends (in a team of four, in other words) and enjoy the banter and working together to achieve your goals</li><br> <br>\nElden Ring for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

The game is set in a fictional universe, in the Kingdom of Lothric, where are lengthy period of enlightenment (literally) is being threatened by the coming of the Age of Dark. The player must ensure the survive of the Age of Fire by ensuring that the First Flame continues to burn a while longer.<br> <br> <h2>About the Game</h2><br>\nThe player takes on the third-person persona of the Ashen One, who is tasked with ‘linking’ the First Flame to keep it burning. The flame is fuelled by the sacrifices of heroes and champions, who willingly sacrifice their souls to the flame, thereby becoming Lords of Cinder. This has happened in an unbroken line from times gone by until now. The Ashen One failed to link the flame and has not become a Lord of Cinder, instead being known as an Unkindled.<br> <br>\nThe Ashen One arises as the player enters the game, and is given the mission of returning the Prince Lothric and the rebellious Lords of Cinder to their rightful places, their thrones in Firelink Shrine. The flame is dying because Prince Lothric has defied his destiny: he must be persuaded otherwise.<br> <br>\nSuccessfully returning the Lords of Cinder and the Prince, they travel on to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame: at this point, after the defeat of the Soul of Cinder, there are four potential endings, more about which see below.<br> <br> <h3>Battles and Treasures and Weapons, Oh My</h3><br>\nIn the course of his mission, the Ashen One must battle using a variety of weapons, that range from bows to swords to throwable projectiles, with shields and evasive manoeuvres an important skill to learn. Each weapon has a standard use and a boost: a powered-up version which must be used sparingly as it does not last long and takes a bit of time to reset once depleted.<br>\nHe will also battle a wide range of creatures, many of them grisly and in keeping with the spectral, supernatural theme of the game. Watch out for skeletal hounds, various hostile lizard-men, the undead in forms that range from skeleton to blood-thirsty knight to the revolting Pus of Man, an enemy who transforms from vaguely normal man-shape into a hideous abyss-tainted corruption. Enemies drop resources though, so be sure to grab them all.<br> <br>\nThe Ashen One can use magic by acquiring FP (focus points) which are used up whenever a spell is cast. Hit Points (HP) is used when taking damage from enemies, and both of these are refilled through estus flasks, magical healing vessels that can be upgraded up to seven times for maximum benefit.<br> <br> <h3>Ending It All</h3><br>\nThere are four potential endings after the Soul of Cinder has been defeated. They are as follows:<br> <li>Link the Flame: The player can attempt to link to the First Flame, ensuring that the Age of Fire will continue</li><br> <li>Summon the Fire Keeper: The Fire Keeper will extinguish the flame and the Age of Dark will begin in earnest</li><br> <li>Kill the Fire Keeper: This is much like the ending above, except after summoning the Fire Keeper, you kill her. Note: you will not receive any end game achievements for playing out this ending. The Fire Keeper will respawn as soon as you leave the area, so you can come back and try again</li><br> <li>Keep the Flame: The Ashen One can choose to keep the flame for themselves, an option which results in his becoming the Dark Lord of Londor</li><br>\nDark Souls 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

These include Luke Skywalker, Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando, Yoda and Rey amongst many others.<br> <br>\r\nThere is a full story arc making the single player mode as immersive and addictive as the multiplayer modes, of which there are many. In single player, the characters must progress along the story arc, to avoid the trap laid by the villain, Emperor Palpatine who wants to lure the Resistance out of hiding and into his clutches. The Imperial Special Forces commandoes declare readiness to battle, but they have underestimated the passion of the rebels.<br> <br>\r\nThere are eleven multiplayer modes, some of which are time limited. Pursue Storm Troopers to the death whereupon they will respawn as your fellow Ewok, face off two on two, heroes versus villains with no respawn capability until the game is over or go big: twenty attackers versus twenty offenders playing over thirteen planets in a huge bid to succeed.<br> <br>\r\nOther multiplayer modes include exercises that will stretch your playing capability as far as possible, with speed, attack and defence each being showcased in turn, or melded together for an exciting showdown that will leave you breathless and hopefully victorious! <br> <br>\r\nExpansion packs and updates have transformed the game, adding new characters, areas and new modes of multiplayer game play. Keep checking back in to see if new features have been added so you can continue to keep playing your beloved game.', 8, 'star-wars-battlefront-ii-cover.jpg', 'star-wars-battlefront-ii-thumbnail.jpg');
